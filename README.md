## About System App

Very sorry to say, but currently, we cannot change the icon of System Apps. Because of the SIP, users or root cannot write things to this app. And the idea of the Bridge App needs to change the `Info.plist`, so it will not work.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the project
2. Download the Fork
3. Open it in the Xcode (>13.3)
4. Start the Contibution
